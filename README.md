# Deep Learning Usecase

To run it you can either:

1. run the Jupyter Notebook in your browser of choice (preferably Firefox/ Chrome) by simply clicking on this badge [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/ompstat-lmu/rcourses_notebook_deeplearning/master?filepath=dl_showcase.ipynb)
2. fork the repo and run the notebook on your local machine via the bash command `cd <local repo> && jupyter notebook`. In this case, make sure that you already installed the required R packages `keras`, `magick` and `grid` as well as the python libraries `h5py 2.8.0`, `tensorflow 1.3.0` and `keras 2.1.2`.
